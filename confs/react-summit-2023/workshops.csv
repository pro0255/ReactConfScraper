May 15, 15:00;0 to Auth in an hour with ReactJS;Asaf Shen;Passwordless authentication may seem complex, but it is simple to add it to any app using the right tool. There are multiple alternatives that are much better than passwords to identify and authenticate your users - including SSO, SAML, OAuth, Magic Links, One-Time Passwords, and Authenticator Apps.While addressing security aspects and avoiding common pitfalls, we will enhance a full-stack JS application (Node.js backend + React frontend) to authenticate users with OAuth (social login) and One Time Passwords (email), including:- User authentication - Managing user interactions, returning session / refresh JWTs- Session management and validation - Storing the session securely for subsequent client requests, validating / refreshing sessions- Basic Authorization - extracting and validating claims from the session token JWT and handling authorization in backend flowsAt the end of the workshop, we will also touch other approaches of authentication implementation with Descope - using frontend or backend SDKs.

May 23, 15:00;Deploying React Native Apps in the Cloud;Cecelia Martinez;Deploying React Native apps manually on a local machine can be complex. The differences between Android and iOS require developers to use specific tools and processes for each platform, including hardware requirements for iOS. Manual deployments also make it difficult to manage signing credentials, environment configurations, track releases, and to collaborate as a team.Appflow is the cloud mobile DevOps platform built by Ionic. Using a service like Appflow to build React Native apps not only provides access to powerful computing resources, it can simplify the deployment process by providing a centralized environment for managing and distributing your app to multiple platforms. This can save time and resources, enable collaboration, as well as improve the overall reliability and scalability of an app.In this workshop, you‚Äôll deploy a React Native application for delivery to Android and iOS test devices using Appflow. You‚Äôll also learn the steps for publishing to Google Play and Apple App Stores. No previous experience with deploying native applications is required, and you‚Äôll come away with a deeper understanding of the mobile deployment process and best practices for how to use a cloud mobile DevOps platform to ship quickly at scale.
May 24, 14:00;Build a Data-Rich Beautiful Dashboard With MUI X's Data Grid and Joy UI;NADA!!;Learn how to put MUI‚Äôs complete ecosystem to use to build a beautiful and sophisticated project management dashboard in a fraction of the time that it would take to construct it from scratch. In particular, we‚Äôll see how to integrate the MUI X Data Grid with Joy UI, our newest component library and sibling to the industry-standard Material UI.Table of contents:- Introducing our project and tools- App setup and package installation- Constructing the dashboard- Prototyping, styling, and themes - Joy UI features- Filtering, sorting, editing - Data Grid features- Conclusion, final thoughts, Q&A
May 25, 15:00;Building Blazing-Fast Websites with Next.js and Sanity.io;NADA!!;Join us for a hands-on workshop where we'll show you how to level up your React skills to build a high-performance headless website using Next.js, Sanity, and the JAMstack architecture. No prior knowledge of Next.js or Sanity is required, making this workshop ideal for anyone familiar with React who wants to learn more about building dynamic, responsive websites.In this workshop, we'll explore how Next.js, a React-based framework, can be used to build a static website with server-side rendering and dynamic routing. You'll learn how to use Sanity as a headless CMS to manage your website‚Äôs content, create custom page templates with Next.js, use APIs to integrate with the CMS, and deploy your website to production with Vercel.By the end of this workshop, you will have a solid understanding of how Next.js and Sanity.io can be used together to create a high-performance, scalable, and flexible website.
Jun 13, 14:00;Back to the Roots With Remix;NADA!!;The modern web would be different without rich client-side applications supported by powerful frameworks: React, Angular, Vue, Lit, and many others. These frameworks rely on client-side JavaScript, which is their core. However, there are other approaches to rendering. One of them (quite old, by the way) is server-side rendering entirely without JavaScript. Let's find out if this is a good idea and how Remix can help us with it?Prerequisites- Good understanding of JavaScript or TypeScript- It would help to have experience with React, Redux, Node.js and writing FrontEnd and BackEnd applications- Preinstall Node.js, npm- We prefer to use VSCode, but also cloud IDEs such as codesandbox (other IDEs are also ok)
Jun 14, 14:00;Designing Effective Tests With React Testing Library;Josh Justice;React Testing Library is a great framework for React component tests because there are a lot of questions it answers for you, so you don‚Äôt need to worry about those questions. But that doesn‚Äôt mean testing is easy. There are still a lot of questions you have to figure out for yourself: How many component tests should you write vs end-to-end tests or lower-level unit tests? How can you test a certain line of code that is tricky to test? And what in the world are you supposed to do about that persistent act() warning?In this three-hour workshop we‚Äôll introduce React Testing Library along with a mental model for how to think about designing your component tests. This mental model will help you see how to test each bit of logic, whether or not to mock dependencies, and will help improve the design of your components. You‚Äôll walk away with the tools, techniques, and principles you need to implement low-cost, high-value component tests.Table of contents- The different kinds of React application tests, and where component tests fit in- A mental model for thinking about the inputs and outputs of the components you test- Options for selecting DOM elements to verify and interact with them- The value of mocks and why they shouldn‚Äôt be avoided- The challenges with asynchrony in RTL tests and how to handle themPrerequisites- Familiarity with building applications with React- Basic experience writing automated tests with Jest or another unit testing framework- You do not need any experience with React Testing Library- Machine setup: Node LTS, Yarn
Jun 19, 14:00;React Performance Debugging Masterclass;Ivan Akulov;Ivan‚Äôs first attempts at performance debugging were chaotic. He would see a slow interaction, try a random optimization, see that it didn't help, and keep trying other optimizations until he found the right one (or gave up).Back then, Ivan didn‚Äôt know how to use performance devtools well. He would do a recording in Chrome DevTools or React Profiler, poke around it, try clicking random things, and then close it in frustration a few minutes later. Now, Ivan knows exactly where and what to look for. And in this workshop, Ivan will teach you that too.Here‚Äôs how this is going to work. We‚Äôll take a slow app ‚Üí debug it (using tools like Chrome DevTools, React Profiler, and why-did-you-render) ‚Üí pinpoint the bottleneck ‚Üí and then repeat, several times more. We won‚Äôt talk about the solutions (in 90% of the cases, it‚Äôs just the ol‚Äô regular useMemo() or memo()). But we‚Äôll talk about everything that comes before ‚Äì and learn how to analyze any React performance problem, step by step.(Note: This workshop is best suited for engineers who are already familiar with how useMemo() and memo() work ‚Äì but want to get better at using the performance tools around React. Also, we‚Äôll be covering interaction performance, not load speed, so you won‚Äôt hear a word about Lighthouse ü§ê)
Jun 20, 14:00;Web Accessibility for Ninjas: A Practical Approach for Creating Accessible Web Applications;NADA!!;In this hands-on workshop, we‚Äôll equip you with the tools and techniques you need to create accessible web applications. We‚Äôll explore the principles of inclusive design and learn how to test our websites using assistive technology to ensure that they work for everyone.We‚Äôll cover topics such as semantic markup, ARIA roles, accessible forms, and navigation, and then dive into coding exercises where you‚Äôll get to apply what you‚Äôve learned. We‚Äôll use automated testing tools to validate our work and ensure that we meet accessibility standards.By the end of this workshop, you‚Äôll be equipped with the knowledge and skills to create accessible websites that work for everyone, and you‚Äôll have hands-on experience using the latest techniques and tools for inclusive design and testing. Join us for this awesome coding workshop and become a ninja in web accessibility and inclusive design!
